# Face Detection Model

Purpose:
 - Build a model that is able to detect several faces and create bounding boxes around those faces. The model will be then compressed to be used in embedded devices. Ideally the model would be lossless, will test several methods of compression and determine several metrics and benchmarks.
 - The model will be built using the Wider Face dataset which contain close 10,000 images and already has split annotated images.
 - Compression of the model will be tested through several methods such as:
    - low rank approximation, knowledge distillation, compact layer design, network pruning and parameter quantization.
 - Metrics for compression would be to test memory latency during inference, video frame rate for detection.
 - Inferenece during video must provide bounding box data and drawing.
